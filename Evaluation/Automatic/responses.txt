Patient Overview
Zanolin Lorenzo (ZNLLNZ00R20G888E) is a 23-year-old male born on October 20, 2000. Account resides in Polcenigo and can be contacted via email at l.zanolin@reply.it.

Health Conditions
Zanolin has been diagnosed with two significant health conditions that require ongoing management and monitoring. Crohn's Disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease affecting the lining of the digestive tract, has been confirmed and is currently classified as severe. Additionally, he has been diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea, a condition where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep, which is confirmed and assessed as moderate.
Both conditions were evaluated during a clinical encounter on July 17, 2024, lasting from 20:00 to 21:15. During this visit, Zanolin reported experiencing problems with his nose and bowel, which are consistent with the symptoms of both Crohn's Disease and Obstructive Sleep Apnea. The concurrent presence of these conditions suggests a complex health profile that may require a multidisciplinary approach to treatment.

Person Allergies
In addition to his chronic health conditions, Zanolin has a confirmed food allergy to lactose. This allergy adds another layer of complexity to his health management, particularly in relation to his Crohn's Disease, as dietary considerations play a crucial role in managing both conditions. The lactose allergy may impact nutritional choices and potentially influence the management strategies for his gastrointestinal symptoms.
The combination of severe Crohn Disease, moderate Obstructive Sleep Apnea, and a lactose allergy presents a challenging health scenario for Zanolin. These conditions may interact with each other, potentially exacerbating symptoms or complicating treatment approaches. For instance, the sleep disruptions caused by Obstructive Sleep Apnea could potentially affect inflammation levels and overall health, which might indirectly influence the management of Crohn Disease. Similarly, the dietary restrictions necessitated by both the lactose allergy and Crohn's Disease will require careful planning to ensure adequate nutrition while avoiding trigger foods.

Dear Lorenzo, I am writing you the report of the last visit carried out at the clinic on 7/17/2024 at 1:00 pm.
The reasons for the visit were two: you felt problems with both your nose and your bowel. As a matter of practice, a measurement of the oxygen level in the blood (SpO2) was carried out, resulting in a standard value of 97%. Subsequently, we focused, one at a time, on the symptoms.

As regards the diarrhea and bowel pain, Chron's Disease was detected, for which you must pay close attention to the diet you follow. The pathology has a very high severity level, therefore the prescribed treatment is to take Cortisone daily for a quantity of approximately 33 mg/day. We will update you gradually to understand how the treatment is progressing.

The second symptomology included discomfort in the nose during the night, more precisely a continuous obstruction of the airways. Currently we remain with a light treatment of daily Tachifludec, 132 mg/day and then we will evaluate how to continue in a few weeks.

I remain available for any clarifications, see you soon!
Sincerely,
Andrea Bianchi
